        <p>Say “Hawaii” and people usually think of Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Lanai, Molokai, Niihau, Kahoolawe and Hawaii. In actuality,
	 the state also encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian islands, a group of islets, seamounts and shoals that extends 1,350 miles
	 northwest of the “main” islands. Harboring an amazing diversity of seabirds and marine life,
	 they are collectively known as the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, a World Heritage Site and the largest contiguous fully protected conservation area under the U.S. flag. 
	Papahanaumokuakea covers 582,578 square miles of the Pacific and is bigger than all of America’s national parks combined.</p>

        <p>On February 14, 1779, Captain James Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island in a skirmish with Hawaiians 
	(he is the British sea captain who is credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands a year earlier). In 1877, 
	Hawaiian Princess Miriam Likelike deeded a 5,682-square-foot parcel near the spot where Cook fell to England 
	for $1 with the stipulation that it be used “to keep and maintain...a monument in memory of Captain Cook.” Walk up to the 
	27-foot white obelisk, and you’ll be on British soil.</p>
