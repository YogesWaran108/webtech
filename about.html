       <a style="color:white;font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Hawaii s a state in the Western United States located in the Pacific Ocean about 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland. It is the only state outside North America, the only state composed entirely of islands, and the only state in the tropics. Hawaii is also one of a few U.S. states to have once been an independent nation.

            History:
        </h2>    
	<h3>First human settlement
	</h3>	
	<p>
	Based on archaeological evidence, the earliest habitation of the Hawaiian Islands dates to around AD 300, 
	probably by Polynesian settlers from the Marquesas Islands.[dubious – discuss] A second wave of migration 
	from Raiatea and Bora Bora took place in the 11th century. The date of the human discovery and habitation 
	of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.[61] Some archaeologists and historians think 
	it was a later wave of immigrants from Tahiti around AD 1000 who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the 
	kapu system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of heiau</p>
	<h3>European arrival

	The 1778 arrival of British explorer Captain James Cook marked the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawaiʻi; 
	early British influence can be seen in the design of the flag of Hawaiʻi, which bears the Union Jack in the top-left corner. Cook named 
	the archipelago "the Sandwich Islands" in honor of his sponsor John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, publishing the islands' location and 
	rendering the native name as Owyhee. The form 'Owyhee' or 'Owhyhee' is preserved in the names of certain locations in the American part of 
	the Pacific Northwest, among them Owyhee County and Owyhee Mountains in Idaho, named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in the area.

	<h3>1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations
	</h3>
	<p>
	In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the 
	document stripped the king of much of his authority. It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised 
	most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite. Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not. 
	As the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution. King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, 
	reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen Liliʻuokalani, succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawaiʻi.
